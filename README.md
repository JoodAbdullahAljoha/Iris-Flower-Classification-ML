# Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

The **Iris dataset** is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning, consisting of **150 records** of iris flowers belonging to three species:
- **Iris setosa**
- **Iris versicolor**
- **Iris virginica**

Each record includes **four features**:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

The goal of this project is to develop a **machine learning model** capable of accurately classifying iris flowers into one of these three species based on their measurements.

## Research Question

Can a machine learning model achieve an **accuracy of at least 95%** in classifying Iris flowers?

## Hypothesis

A **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model will achieve an accuracy of at least **95%** in classifying Iris flowers.

## Models Used

Three different machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
3. **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

### Results:
- **Logistic Regression**: **97.77% Accuracy**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: **97.77% Accuracy**
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: **95.55% Accuracy**

Both **Logistic Regression** and **SVM** outperformed KNN, achieving the highest accuracy of **97.77%**, demonstrating their effectiveness in handling both **linear and non-linear** decision boundary scenarios.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **scikit-learn** (for machine learning algorithms)
- **NumPy** & **Pandas** (for data processing)
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** (for visualization)
